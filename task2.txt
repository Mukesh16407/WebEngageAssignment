Dear Account Manager,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inform you that the expected delivery 
date for the task is 05-02-2023.due to a family emergency  I will not be able to meet the original deadline.
I understand the importance of delivering the task on time and I want to assure you that I am doing everything in my power to 
resolve the situation as quickly as possible. In light of this, I am respectfully requesting an extension of three days 
to allow me to complete the task to the best of my ability.

Please let me know if this request is feasible and if there is anything else I can do to support you during this time. 
I understand the inconvenience this may cause and I deeply apologize for any disruption to your plans.

Thank you for your understanding and support during this difficult time.
Best regards,
Mukesh Kumar
